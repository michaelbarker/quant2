Note on Redistribution of ICPSR Data. 
	- Note: ICPSR terms of use limit redistribution of data
	- Not a good choice, unless data set is already in the format we want to use in class.
	- Technically, we can not resave the data set in another format and redistribute through Blackboard. 
	- Actually, it seems we can redistribute the data. The terms of use state: 

		Redistribution of Data	
			You agree not to redistribute data or other materials without the written agreement of ICPSR, unless:
			 - You serve as the OFFICIAL or DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE at an ICPSR MEMBER INSTITUTION and are assisting AUTHORIZED USERS with obtaining data, or
			 - You are collaborating with other AUTHORIZED USERS to analyze the data for research or instructional purposes.
			When sharing data or other materials in these approved ways, you must include all accompanying files with the data, including terms of use. More information on permission to redistribute data can be found on the ICPSR Web site.

		Definitions
			authorized user: A faculty member, staff member, or student at a member institution

	- Georgetown is a member institution, so we are authorized users collaborating with other authorized users for instructional purposes.
