# Project 4: School Improvement 2010 Grants 
McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University

### Overview
In this project, we wll look at school grant data that is available at the website: www.data.gov.
After some preliminary work cleaning importing and cleaning this data set, we will begin working
with local macros and loops. These are very powerful tools, and will save you a lot of time
once you learn how to use them. 

## Week 1:

### Questions

3.1 Download and import data 
 - Download data from `http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-improvement-2010-grants`
 - Or, go to data.gov and search for "School Improvement 2010 Grants".
 - The data set is named: `userssharedsdfschoolimprovement2010grants.csv`.
 - `csv` stands for "comma separated values". It is just a text file with commas between variable columns.
 - You can open the .csv file with Notepad or Wordpad if you want to see how the data is saved in `.csv` files. 
 - The command `import delimited` is used to open .csv files in Stata.
 - You will need to include the option `bindquotes(strict)` in your command.
 - You should also include an option to treat the first row as variable names. 


3.2 Destring 
 - Consider the variable, `v5`.
 - This variable did not get a proper variable name, because the variable name in the `.csv` file began with a number.
 - Stata does not allow variable names to begin with a number, so leaves the name as `v5`. 
 - For other Stata variable naming rules, see `help varname`.
 - Examine the variable `v5` using `browse`, `describe`, and/or `summarize`.
 - The variable `v5` was imported as a string, but it should be a numeric variable. 
 - This happens because there is some non-numeric character in the variable.
 - You can fix this problem with the `destring` command. 
 - Use the `generate()` option to create a new numeric variable name `grantamt`.
 - Use a second option to ignore the non-numeric character, `$`, that caused this variable to be imported as a string.

3.3 Encode
 - Consider the variable `modelselected`.
 - This variable was correctly imported as a string variable.
 - We still must transform it into a numeric variable before analysis, but not using `destring`.
 - `destring` is only useful to convert variables that should be numbers, but were incorrectly read as strings. 
 - For a legitimate categorical string variable, you should use `encode`.
 - You've used `encode` in previous projects. See `help encode` to review the command.
 - Use `encode` to generate a numeric variable called `model`, with labeled categories corresponding to those in `modelselected`.

 3.4 Missing Data
 - Summarize your two new variables, `grantamt` and `model`. 
 - Do they have the same number of observations? Why or why not?
 - Use the command `misstable summarize` to get more detailed information on missing values for these two variables. 
 - What does the column: `Obs<.` mean?
 - Remember, in Stata the missing value `.`, is the largest number Stata can hold. So if an observation is `<.`, it is non-missing. 
 - Examine the observations with missing data: `browse if grantamt==. | model==.`.

3.5 Non-missing Sample
 - Suppose you want to produce summary statistics only for those observations that have no missing data.
 - This is a very common task that must be done with almost any data analysis project. 
 - In this simple example, you could use the same approach we used with the previous `browse` command: `summarize grantamt model if grantamt!=. & model!=.`
 - But in a real project, you might have many, many more variables.  
 - You will want to create a single dummy variable, `nomissing`, to mark the observations that have no missing data.
 - Then you can use: `summarize grantamt model if nomissing==1` 
 - First, use the egen function `rowmiss()` to create a new variable, `nummiss`, containing the number of missing variables for each observation.
 - Then, use that variable to create the `nomissing` variable. `nomissing` should equal 1 if `nummiss` equals zero.
 - After each step, review the variables you have created: `browse if missing(grantamt, model)`
 - Summarize `grantamt` and tabulate `model` for the non-missing sample only.
 - Both tables should report 757 observations.

3.6 Missing Dummies
 - Another very common data procedure for missing values is to create missing-value dummy variables.
 - Once missing-value dummies are created, the original missing values may be replaced with zeros.
 - You will learn more about the reasoning behind these processes and when they are appropriate in quant class.
 - Commands to perform these operations for `grantamt` are given below. 
 - Repeat these commands for the variable `model`. 
```
gen     miss_grantamt = 0
replace miss_grantamt = 1 if grantamt==.
replace grantamt = 0 if grantamt==.
browse if miss_grantamt==1
```

3.7 Looping over variables
 - Working with data, you can spend a lot of time typing a series of repetitive commands for many variables.
 - The previous task of creating missing value dummies is a good example.
 - When you encounter this type of problem, the fastest and easiest way to proceed is to find a command that can operate on a `varlist`.
 - For example, look at the help page for `destring`. In the syntax statement, it accepts a `varlist`, so you can specify as many variables as you want.
 - `destring` will essentially loop over each variable in the `varlist`, repeating the same operation. 
 - Now look at the help page for `encode`. It takes a `varname`, so only one variable may be specified each time the command is used.
 - To learn more about these syntax statements, see `help language`.
 - The following commands will create missing value dummies and replace initial missing values for a list of variables:
 - These two commands can be applied to any number of variables, just by adding them to the `varlist`.  
 ```
misstable grantamt model , generate(miss_)
recode grantamt model (.=0)
```
 - Try to find a command that produces one-way tabulations and accepts a `varlist`.
 - Use this command to produce one-way tabulations of both of the missing-value dummy variables, `miss_*`. 

3.8 Local macros
 - Of course, you can't always find a pre-programmed command to do exactly what you need to do.
 - You may need to write your own loop to automate repetitive commands.
 - Loops in Stata are based on `local macros`, or `locals`, so you must understand those before you can understand loops. 
 - A `local` in Stata is a single word that gets replaced with other words when a do-file is executed. 
 - To use a `local`, first define the replacement text, then when you write the name of the local in your do-file, and surround it in the single quote marks (`local'), it is as if you typed in the replacement text.
 - In the example below, the first line is the definition, and the second line is the replacement.
```
local mynumber 4
generate x_4 = `mynumber'
```
 - Try running these commands and examine the results. But be aware of the following things:
 - The left and right expansion quotes are different. The left quote is on the top left of the keyboard, the right quote is on the middle-right of the keyboard. Ask your TA if you can't find these two keys.
 - Local macros must be defined and used within a do-file. You cannot use them from the command line. 
 - If you are running separate pieces of a do-file by highlighting them, you must highlight both the definition and the replacement line and run them together.
 - `locals` are interpreted just as if you typed their contents into the do-file. So you can use them in many different ways:
``` 
local nextnumber 5
generate x_`nextnumber' = `nextnumber'
```

3.9 Display
 - When you start using `locals`, it is easy to make mistakes, and it's not always easy to figure out where the problem is.
 - When you encounter a problem, first make sure the contents of your local are what you think they are.
 - The `display` command is very useful for this.
 - You can put the local and/or the entire command in quotes, and display it to the results window.
 - This allows you to see what command you're actually trying to run, and can help identify errors. 
 - Add `display` commands to your do-file, as below. Re-run the do-file from beginning, or you will get errors from trying to recreate `x_4` and `x_5`.
```
local mynumber 4
display "The local macro named mynumber is equal to: `mynumber'"
display "The command I am trying to run is: generate x_4 = `mynumber'"
generate x_4 = `mynumber'
local nextnumber 5
display "The local macro named nextnumber is equal to: `nextnumber'"
display "The command I am trying to run is: generate x_`nextnumber' = `nextnumber'"
generate x_`nextnumber' = `nextnumber'
```
 - Modify these commands to make two new variables, `x_6` and `x_7`, that contain the values 6 and 7, respectively. 

3.10 foreach Loops
 - Suppose we wanted to make `x_' variables for all numbers 1-10. 
 - You could paste the same commands and just change the local value each time:
 ```
 local num 1
 display "generate x_`num' = `num'"
 generate x_`num' = `num'
 local num 2
 generate x_`num' = `num'
 local num 3
 generate x_`num' = `num'
 etc... 
 ```
 - This is the basic idea behind loops in Stata. 
 - You specify a local macro name and a list of items, then the loop gets executed one time for each item. 
 - Here is an example using `display`
 ```
 foreach food in carrots pasta soup salad {
	 display "Today, I want to eat `food'"
 }
 ```
 - Try writing a loop to create `x_` variables for values 1-10, using a `foreach` loop.
