# Project 1: Ambulatory Care Medical Data
McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University

## Week 2: Complex Variable Creation 
### Key Ideas:

 - Egen command 
 - bysort prefix 

### Overview

- We will continue with the project we started last week 
- You may have to re-download the data set and documentation from Blackboard
- Like last week, save all project files to a dedicated folder 
- Download the provided solutions from last week to your project folder
- Review the solution and ask questions if there is anything you don't understand
- For the questions this week, do not start a new do-file
- Continue adding commands, either to your previous do-file from last week or to the solution do-file from Blackboard 

### Questions

1.11. Confirm Sample
- Last week we restricted our data set to patients age 18 and older.

1.12. Recode missing
- We will be working with the following variables this week
- For each variable, check for negative values 
- Recode -7, -8, and -9 to missing for each of these variables
