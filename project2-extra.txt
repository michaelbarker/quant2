2.2. First Sample Selection
We want to limit the analysis sample to a subset of schools. 
First, consider the variable `sector_name`, which describes the category of the academic institution.
Based on this variable, limit the sample to 4-year institutions that are publically owned or non-profit.
You can use either the `keep` or `drop` command to do this.
Make sure you consider the storage type of the variable (string or numeric).
You may want to use copy/paste to make sure you don't make any mistakes when you type the various values of `sector_name`.
 - Use the variable `sector_name` to limit the sample to nonprofit and public 4-year institutions.
 - Verify that your data set now has 13,708 observations.

2.3. Second Sample Selection
We will continue to refine our sample based on `classification_name`. 
There are several organizations that set rules for college athletics. 
This variable specifies the governing body that each institution belongs to.
We want to keep only schools that belong to the "NCAA", in any division.
Like `sector_name`, this variable is a string, but it has many entries. 
We don't want to have to type all of those entries, so we will use a short-cut.
We will keep only those schools where the letters "NCAA" appear anywhere in the name.
We will use the string function `strmatch()`. 
Read about this function, and other string functions, on the help page for string functions.
```
help string functions
describe classification_name
tab classification_name
tab classification_name if strmatch(classification_name, "*NCAA*")
keep if strmatch(classification_name, "*NCAA*")
```
There are several schools we want to drop based on institution_name.
We don't think that mining or maritime schools are comparable to the other schools in our sample.
Use the `strmatch()` function to drop these two type of schools.
 - Drop all schools that have the word "Mines" in their name. 
 - Use the strmatch() function to drop schools that have the word "Maritime" in their name.
