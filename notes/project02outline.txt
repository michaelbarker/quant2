* Data:
Should be in either .csv or excel format
(But we can format it however we want)

Plenty of categorical variables
In class focus is on individual data: birthweight, wages
But, also discuss crime and police example on cities
Maybe something with industry and occupation categories
Categories should come in as strings, then use encode

* Week 1
import excel or delimited 
Simple indicator creation
regression
test
indicators with factor variables
regression 
replay regression with coeflegend option
test 3.industry, etc.
testparm

recode many categories to few, then i.
outreg2

label values, then i.
then outreg2

Simple interaction term
interactions with factor variables
replace, coefl


* Week 2
Illustrate last week's regressions with graphs
Maybe do these together - don't break them up into two weeks. 
For each concept, graph and analysis together?
Better for statistical concepts, worse for Stata learning.
Or, do graphs first, analysis second?
